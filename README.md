In this project I used python to access IBM DB2 server, then created tables, inserted values, used joins to combine tables, modifide tables and extracted the needed information by using SQL
I used as sample this 3 CSV files:
1. Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago
2. Chicago Public Schools
3. Chicago Crime Data
